# Journaling App Requirements

## What are 3 problems that journaling helps with?
- I often forget what has happened to me throughout the week
- I sometimes feel the need to be creative and express myself on the page
- I sometimes get ideas or thoughts that need to be dumped, or need to be stored for later and getting them out helps me mentally organise

## What are 3 outcomes I'd like to see from a journaling app
As a person with a poor memory
But high access to a computer, phone, and internet
I want to store events, activities, thoughts etc somewhere that is easily accessible
So that I am able to look back and remember what I was doing or thinking in certain periods
- Relate entries to dates/times
- Easily recall, find, be reminded of entries
- See related entries so I can see trends in my thinking, activities etc
- See a history so I can relive the whole mental journey that got me to a particular place
- Spell checking

As a person with creative tendencies
But fleeting time or energy to act on them
I want to be able to express my thoughts and feelings in a fun and non-limiting way
So that I am able to feel creatively fullfilled in micro-bursts
- A mixture of mediums
- A mixture of creative writing forms

As a person who likes to stay mentally healthy
I want to be able to express my thoughts and feelings in private, safe, and convenient way
So I can organise my thoughts and better process difficult or complex situations
- Controlled access - some private, some shared with therapist or close friends
- A way to draw conclusions, action items, or outcomes
- A way to highlight priority/key info
- An easy way to simply express complex feelings or ideas

## What makes a good single page journaling app?
- Simple information architecture 
- Simple action and data hierarchies (calls to action are obvious)
- Content is the most important thing
- Ultra convenient and easy to use
- Personal and comfortable
